# House Price Prediction - Regression Analysis

## 1. Defining the Question
### a) Specifying the Question
As a Data Scientist, you work for Hass Consulting Company which is a real estate leader with over 25 years of experience. You have been tasked to study the factors that affect housing prices using the given information on real estate properties that was collected over the past few months.

Later onwards, create a model that would allow the company to accurately predict the sale of prices upon being provided with the predictor variables.

### b) Defining the Metric for Success
A model that accurately predicts the sale of prices upon being provided with the predictor variables.

#### Regression techniques
Multiple Linear Regression

Quantile Regression

Ridge Regression

Lasso Regression

Elastic Net Regression

### c) Understanding the context
Tasked to study the factors that affect housing prices using the given information on real estate properties collected over the past few months. Later to, create a model that would allow the company to accurately predict the sale of prices upon being provided with the predictor variables.
